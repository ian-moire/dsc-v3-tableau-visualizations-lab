# Useful Visualizations - Lab

## Introduction
In the previous lesson we discussed a few of the visualizations that are very useful in Tableau. In this lab, we will generate each of the vizzes we discussed and add a little extra useful information. We will then save the vizzes to Tableau Public for use in a later lesson.

## Objectives
You will be able to: 
* Generate a useful Bar Chart
* Create an informative Scatter Plot
* Generate a Line Graph with a Trend Line
* Save all vizzes to Tableau Public

## Getting Started
Open Tableau Public and load the __SuperStore_ data set. Choose the _Sales_ worksheet and drag it to the workspace. Once you have done these steps, you are ready to move on to the next section.

## Bar Chart
Our first viz to create is going to be a _Bar Chart_. Drag the necessary _Measures_ to the workspace to create a Bar Chart which shows the _Profit_ by _Sub-Category_. 
* Make the viz fit _The Entire View_.
* Sort the values in either _Ascending_ or _Descending_ order, whichever you prefer.
* Add some _Color_ to show the different _Category_ each item is in. You can keep the default color palette or you can choose your own colors.
* Add a _Label_ to the _Profit_ to show the value for each of the _Sub-Category_ elements.
* Format the _Label_ to show that it is currency and make it easier to read by scaling the values to thousands with _0_ decimal places.
* Change the information for the _Category_ in the _Tooltip_ so it reads "Department" instead of "Category."
* Add a custom _Title_ and make it something descriptive like "Profits by Sub-Category."

Now you have a Bar Chart that has some useful information on it. You can see that all of the bars are colored in one of three colors which shows which _Category_ they are in. You can easily see values of each bar in the chart with the _Label_ at the end of each bar. You can hover over any of the bars and see the information in the _Tooltip_ and the _Category_ is now labeled as _Department_. 

> __Level Up__
> * Add some additional details like _Bold_ text to the _Department_ in the _Tooltip_. 
> * _Italicize_ the currency amount in the _Tooltip_.
> * Edit the _Profit_ Axis and add a dollar sign to the values to reflect that it is currency.
> * Add some other color or formatting features to personalize your viz.

Once you are finished, remember to save your viz to Tableau Public so we can use it later. Once you are finished, your viz should look similar to the one below.
